Project originally created for the 2020 course Automated Transactional Systems by Mateusz Andrzejewski and Jakub Cudak.  
  
It was based on articles from the QuantStart website:  
- Backtesting a Forecasting Strategy for the S&P500 in Python with pandas: https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Backtesting-a-Moving-Average-Crossover-in-Python-with-pandas/
- Research Backtesting Environments in Python with pandas: https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Research-Backtesting-Environments-in-Python-with-pandas/
- Forecasting Financial Time Series - Part I: https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Forecasting-Financial-Time-Series-Part-1/
  
Ideas for extending the project include:  
1. Portfolio - Including results obtained without including trading costs
2. Features - Fractitonally Differenced Returns (from Advances in Financial Machine Learning)
3. Strategies - simple ARIMA & GARCH strategy
4. Strategies - Pair trading strategy
5. Strategies - Bet sizing (from Advances in Financial Machine Learning)
6. Portfolio - building a multi-strategy portfolio
7. Portfolio - trading futures instead of indices
8. Features - including a sentiment index
